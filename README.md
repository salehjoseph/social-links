# My Social Links Profile

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge. This project is part of my journey to enhance my coding skills through [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges.

**To complete this challenge, I have utilized my understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The Challenge

My goal was to build out this social links profile to closely match the provided design. Users should be able to see hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## Getting Started

1. **Design Files**: I based my project on the designs found in the `/design` folder, which includes both mobile and desktop versions.
2. **Assets**: All necessary assets are in the `/assets` folder, including optimized images and font files. I chose to use local font files for better control over the design.
3. **Style Guide**: A `style-guide.md` file contains important information, such as the color palette and fonts I've used.

## My Workflow

Hereâ€™s the approach I took to complete this project:

1. **Initialize a GitHub Repository**: I created a public repository to share my code with others and to keep track of my progress.
2. **Publish My Code**: I configured my repository to publish my project online, making it easy to share my work.
3. **Plan the Project**: I reviewed the designs and planned my approach, focusing on reusable CSS classes.
4. **HTML Structure**: I structured my content with HTML first to ensure clarity and organization.
5. **Base Styles**: I defined base styles, including `font-family` and `font-size`, to establish a consistent look.
6. **Styling**: I added styles section by section, ensuring each part met my expectations before moving on.

## Deployment

I chose to host my project using:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
